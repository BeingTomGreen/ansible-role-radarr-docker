## Docker compose bits

# Defines the containers service name.
radarr_docker_service_name: "radarr"

# User that will own the compose files.
radarr_docker_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"

# Base path for deployment.
radarr_docker_base_directory: '/srv/radarr_docker'

## Container Image Settings

# Defines the number of usable CPUs for service container.
radarr_docker_cpu_count:

# Defines the usable percentage of the available CPUs.
radarr_docker_cpu_percentage:

# Defines, as integer value, a service container's relative CPU weight versus other containers.
radarr_docker_cpu_shares:

# Configures CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period when a platform is based on Linux kernel.
radarr_docker_cpu_period:

# Configures CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota when a platform is based on Linux kernel.
radarr_docker_cpu_quota:

# Configures CPU allocation parameters for platforms with support for real-time scheduler. It can be either an integer value using microseconds as unit or a duration.
radarr_docker_cpu_rt_runtime:

# Configures CPU allocation parameters for platforms with support for real-time scheduler. It can be either an integer value using microseconds as unit or a duration.
radarr_docker_cpu_rt_period:

# Define the number of (potentially virtual) CPUs to allocate to service containers. This is a fractional number. 0.000 means no limit.
radarr_docker_cpus:

# Defines the explicit CPUs in which to permit execution. Can be a range 0-3 or a list 0,1.
radarr_docker_cpuset:

# Specifies additional container capabilities as strings.
radarr_docker_cap_add: []

# Specifies container capabilities to drop as strings.
radarr_docker_cap_drop: []

# A string that specifies a custom container name, rather than a name generated by default.
# Follows the regex format of [a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+
radarr_docker_container_name: 'radarr'

# Defines a list of device mappings for created containers in the form of HOST_PATH:CONTAINER_PATH[:CGROUP_PERMISSIONS].
radarr_docker_devices: []
# Example:
# radarr_docker_devices:
# - '/dev/dri:/dev/dri'
# - '/dev/kfd:/dev/kfd'

# Defines custom DNS servers to set on the container network interface configuration. It can be a single value or a list.
radarr_docker_dns:

# List custom DNS options to be passed to the container’s DNS resolver (/etc/resolv.conf file on Linux).
radarr_docker_dns_opt:

# Defines custom DNS search domains to set on container network interface configuration. It can be a single value or a list.
radarr_docker_dns_search:

# Defines custom DNS search domains to set on container network interface configuration. It can be a single value or a list.
radarr_docker_domainname:

# The environment attribute defines environment variables set in the container.
radarr_docker_environment:
  PUID: 1000
  PGID: 1000
  TZ: 'Etc/UTC'

# Declares a custom host name to use for the service container. It must be a valid RFC 1123 hostname.
radarr_docker_hostname:

# Specifies the image to start the container from. Must follow the Open Container Specification addressable image format, as [<registry>/][<project>/]<image>[:<tag>|@<digest>].
radarr_docker_image: "lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest"

# Add metadata to containers. You can use either an array or a map.
radarr_docker_labels: []

# Configures a limit on the amount of memory a container can allocate, set as a string expressing a byte value.
radarr_docker_mem_limit:

# Configures a reservation on the amount of memory a container can allocate, set as a string expressing a byte value.
radarr_docker_mem_reservation:

# Defines as a percentage, a value between 0 and 100, for the host kernel to swap out anonymous memory pages used by a container.
radarr_docker_mem_swappiness:

# Defines the amount of memory the container is allowed to swap to disk. This is a modifier attribute that only has meaning if memory is also set.
# Using swap lets the container write excess memory requirements to disk when the container has exhausted all the memory that is available to it.
# There is a performance penalty for applications that swap memory to disk often.
radarr_docker_memswap_limit:

# sets a service container's network mode.
# Can be: null (if using port mapping/networks) 'none', 'host', 'service:<service-name>' or 'container:<container-name>'
radarr_docker_network_mode:

# Sets a service container's network mode.
radarr_docker_networks: []
# Example:
# radarr_docker_networks:
#  - 'mediarr'

# Define the port mappings between the host machine and the containers
radarr_docker_ports:
  - '7878:7878'

# Defines the decisions Compose makes when it starts to pull images. Possible values are
# always, never, missing, build, daily, weekly, every_<duration>
radarr_docker_pull_policy:

# Defines the policy that the platform applies on container termination.
radarr_docker_restart_policy:

# Specifies which runtime to use for the service’s containers.
radarr_docker_runtime:

# The volumes attribute define mount host paths or named volumes that are accessible by service containers.
radarr_docker_volumes:
  - "{{ radarr_docker_base_directory }}/config:/config"
# - '/path/to/movies:/movies'
# - '/path/to/downloads:/downloads'
